# constructionequipmentanalytics
A personal playground for learning new techniques and models with data from the construction equipment space.

### What Is This?
I got my first real taste of data cleansing and analytics during a stint as an analyst focused on construction equipment market trends and valuations. So when I got my hands on this dataset from Kaggle, I couldn't resist doing some deep dives here given my background in the space. 

### Where's the Data Coming From?
Blue Book for Dozers: A Kaggle dataset used for a 2016 competition. I claim no ownership of the data or source material for this dataset, and am grateful to Kaggle for continuing to make it freely available for equipment data geeks like me. More details on Kaggle and the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers


### But, Why?
First and foremost, because it's fun. There's nothing more satisfying than uncovering something of significance in a dataset and using that to inform your team's decision-making. For a kid who grew up on the Hardy Boys and Sherlock Holmes, this is the best part of the job.

Secondly, I've been away from meaningful, hands-on analytics for a while as I've pursued leadership roles. I'm using this as a fun way to improve dormant skills, learn new techniques, and explore emerging trends in data viz and data science.


### Can I Use This?
Sure! As of launching this, I don't expect any of my "dusting off skills" to be new or revolutionary advancements construction equipment analysis. That being said, these insights are here if you're interested.
